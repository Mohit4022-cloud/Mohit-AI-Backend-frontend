# Mohit AI Frontend Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- A production server or cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure, Vercel, etc.)

## Production Build Verification

The application has been fully prepared for production deployment with:
- ✅ All TypeScript errors fixed
- ✅ Security headers configured
- ✅ Environment variables setup
- ✅ SEO optimization
- ✅ PWA manifest
- ✅ Error boundaries
- ✅ Production-ready Docker configuration

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t mohit-ai-frontend .
```

2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env.production mohit-ai-frontend
```

### Option 2: Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

1. Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. Deploy:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard

### Option 3: Traditional Server Deployment

1. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Use a process manager like PM2:
```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start npm --name "mohit-ai" -- start
```

### Option 4: AWS/GCP/Azure

Use the provided Dockerfile with your cloud provider's container service:
- AWS: ECS or App Runner
- GCP: Cloud Run
- Azure: Container Instances

## Environment Variables

Ensure all production environment variables are set:

```bash
# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://api.yourdomain.com

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key

# Optional: Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=your-google-analytics-id
```

## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set
- [ ] Test WebSocket connections
- [ ] Check security headers (use securityheaders.com)
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate
- [ ] Test error boundaries with Sentry or similar
- [ ] Monitor bundle size and performance
- [ ] Set up monitoring (Datadog, New Relic, etc.)
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Configure rate limiting

## Performance Optimization

The build includes:
- Automatic code splitting
- Image optimization
- CSS optimization with Critters
- Bundle analysis available with `npm run analyze`

## Monitoring

Consider setting up:
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Performance monitoring (Datadog, New Relic)
- Uptime monitoring (Pingdom, UptimeRobot)
- Log aggregation (Loggly, Papertrail)

## Rollback Strategy

1. Keep previous Docker images tagged with version numbers
2. Use blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates
3. Maintain database migration rollback scripts

## Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check the build logs: `npm run build`
2. Verify environment variables
3. Check browser console for client-side errors
4. Review server logs for API connection issues
